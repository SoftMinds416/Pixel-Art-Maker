## Going the Udacity Way
It's been a whole world of experiences, Learning, networking and committing to knowing and researching. It may not have been easy as thought 
initially before the commencement of this journey, but it has been wortH it. With a community of "one-teach-one", learning the rudiments of Basic Web developments, 
Coding using DOMs, jQuery and Java scripts in websites is facinating even when at some point one is left with not option of dozing off on his "coding desk".
